                        The painting Women with Baskets by Anita Magsaysay-Ho is a prominent
                        Filipino artist known for her Social Realist and post-Cubist portrayals
                        of women in Filipino culture. The artwork depicts four women carrying
                        baskets, symbolizing the burdens and responsibilities women often carry
                        in their lives. The muted earth colors and subtle details create a rich
                        visual experience, capturing the essence of the subjects with grace and
                        strength. This piece is significant not only for its artistic merit but
                        also for its personal connection, as it was personally gifted by the
                        artist to a distinguished family, reflecting deep friendship and artistic
                        collaboration.</p>
